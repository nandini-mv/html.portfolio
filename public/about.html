<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hey there! I’m Nandini, an EEE student who loves learning new tech skills and creating meaningful projects. I’ve been exploring Python, HTML, and web development, and recently started building my own portfolio. I’m also passionate about AI, sensors, and IoT, and love working on ideas that can make a difference. When I’m not coding, you’ll probably find me singing Carnatic music or playing badminton!
